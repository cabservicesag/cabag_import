now:
----

* if .value is not set within the conf all fieldProcs should take $this->currentFieldValue, otherwise it's not possible to stack the fieldProcs

* new image fieldproc
	1 = preg_replace
	1 {
		value ={$id}
		fromt = /^([0-9]{4}).*/
		to = $1
	}
	2 = files
	2 {
		preg_match = /.*{$currentValue}[^\/]*.jpg/
		sourceFolder = fileadmin/user_upload/shop_images/
		destinationFolder = uploads/tx_cabagshop/
		recursive = 1
		rename = {$currentValue}-{$number}.jpg
	}

* fix multiple issues with label that are not read or translated
* make the whole thing even more Extbase:
	* put the output into fluid templates => 2.5.9
	* create fluid templates for the views => 2.6.0
	* add typoscript configuration => 2.6.1
	* test everything => 2.7.0
	* integrate new features and bugfixes from separate fork => 2.8.0
* improve UX => 3.1.0
	* add ProgressReader interface
	* add ProgressWriter interface
	* add javascript able to call the reader
* add batch processing => 3.2.0
	* add general option to say what import comes next
	* add option to play through the batch in the UI
	* add option to let the cli do the whole batch
* cleanup the remains


later:
------
* test the cli script why the overwriteConf functionality fails. Something with the eval is wrong.
* import without pid should be possible if special config value is set
* clean up backend module, make it configurabel
* throw exceptions with row number
* restructure "source_file" class
	1.) constructure has to check everything
	2.) main will open everything
	3.) close function will close and archive everything
		-> call by handler when everything worked
* load source dynamicaly as fieldprocs are loaded
* try and catch just where usefull
* check configuration settings with if statements where you need them and not in a central foreach (especially in source classe)
* interprets dynamic loading
* speed optimization for the constant replacement

DONE:
-----
* bug im transform fixen
* rename db to storage and make it dynamicaly loadable
* create new storage which works only with sql
